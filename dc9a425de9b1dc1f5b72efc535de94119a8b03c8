Does it make more sense to define them first, and then just use the enums directly?  \n\ni.e. - Define an enum with name LogLevel, and then use it as needed?\n\nThis could potentially avoid renaming all enums to `Types`.",

      "message": "Make sense. I can only guess why someone chooses to define Enums inside Message structures. You can not have the same name in different Enums e.g. AdminState.Unknown and OperationalState.Unknown can not be defined in this way. I believe they chose to put Enums inside Messages for this reason.
