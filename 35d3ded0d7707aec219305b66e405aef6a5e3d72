      "message": "The port_no currently is created using encodings of different things like the port type, interface id etc and so using a uuid as the value is not really feasible.\n\nCurrently the port_no is unique within a device. We thought of having something which is unique within the complete system so an UUID in the same lines as device_id.\n\nAs the JIRA VOL-2953 says, having this system wide unique id would make the life of NB systems easier.",

      "message": "So, after looking at the other patchsets related to this jira:\n\nWould it not be easier to just document that the deviceid+port_no uniquely identifies a port?\n\nThe approach used in this patch \u0026 the jira adds another identifier to keep track of.\n\nIt makes sense (to me) to think of a port as a sub-resource of a device, and thus to require both deviceID (either explicitly or from context) along with portNo to uniquely identify a device.  This avoids the issue of having to do a lookup from the (new) port id to device id \u0026 portNo.\n\nI\u0027m generally opposed to this approach, as it adds another identifier to something that\u0027s already uniquely identifiable, albeit using a composite key.\n\nThis would cause more complexity rather than less when handling ports in certain places.  I have a work-in-progress LogicalDevice port-management patch that would be impacted by this.\n\n\nTL;DR:  I\u0027m opposed to these changes as-is, would like to discuss further if possible.",
