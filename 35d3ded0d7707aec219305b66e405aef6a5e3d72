      "message": "The port_no currently is created using encodings of different things like the port type, interface id etc and so using a uuid as the value is not really feasible.\n\nCurrently the port_no is unique within a device. We thought of having something which is unique within the complete system so an UUID in the same lines as device_id.\n\nAs the JIRA VOL-2953 says, having this system wide unique id would make the life of NB systems easier.",
