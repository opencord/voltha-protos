      "message": "This breaks proto backward compatibility (not sure if any system is using this data). As a good practice it\u0027s better to assign it a new number (e.g. 10, to leave room for other subcategories if needed). \n\nThinking a little bit more about the RPC subcategory, given that the category field is quite generic, would it be helpful to add subcategories that could actually be relevant to RPC events?  I am thinking about using \"FLOWS\", \"PORTS\", \"DEVICE\", \"DB\" as subcategories.  This way if something want to know how many database errors we are seeing then a quick filter on \"DB\" subcategory would be helpful.   Thoughts?",
