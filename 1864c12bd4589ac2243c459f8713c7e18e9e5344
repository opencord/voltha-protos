      "message": "This breaks proto backward compatibility (not sure if any system is using this data). As a good practice it\u0027s better to assign it a new number (e.g. 10, to leave room for other subcategories if needed). \n\nThinking a little bit more about the RPC subcategory, given that the category field is quite generic, would it be helpful to add subcategories that could actually be relevant to RPC events?  I am thinking about using \"FLOWS\", \"PORTS\", \"DEVICE\", \"DB\" as subcategories.  This way if something want to know how many database errors we are seeing then a quick filter on \"DB\" subcategory would be helpful.   Thoughts?",

      "message": "For having Subcategory as DB or PORTS or Device, we will have to track the error from all functions and change the subcategory accordingly, specifically for DB case. Since rpc events will only be send on those failures which are silent and not known to the user so I guess we can have none field as the subcategory because one will be more interested in failures for a particular rpc. What do you suggest",

      "message": "Ideally, it would be good that an RPC failure also provide some root-cause explicitly in the event.  For example, in a heavy load scenario if a lot of RPC failures are occurring, wouldn\u0027t it be nice to be able to narrow it down quickly to a dB overload?  Now, there will be RPCs with no subcategories, e.g. those where the Core is waiting for an adapter response.  However, for those RPC requests from the Adapters I would think there should be a way to categorize any failure in the core.    I am not suggesting this have to be done in this Jira.  Just that, if it\u0027s a small change then might as well include it.",
