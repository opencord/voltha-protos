      "message": "I have two suggestions for better API design: \n\nOption 1: Use a single API and differentiated input messages\nmessage OnuIdentifier {\n    oneof id_type {\n        InterfaceOnuId onuid \u003d 1;         \n        InterfaceOnuSerialNumber sn \u003d 2;\n    }\n}\nrpc DisableOnu (OnuIdentifier)...\n\nOption 2: Seperate APIs related with the action\nrpc DisableActiveOnu (InterfaceOnuId): Disable an activated ONU which has an ONU id.\nrpc DisablePreprovisionedOnu: This is an ONU connected to the OLT but is not activated yet. I believe VOLTHA enables all the ONUs automatically so this is a case where an ONU is problematatic and could not be activated in normal methods. PreprovisionedONU may not cover this case entirerly but I could not find out a better name.\n",
