      "message": "Question: This is a legacy question not directly related to the submitted patch.\n\nWhy are we checking a compiled binary into revision control ?  Should(nt) the logic flow be repo:voltha-protos -- checkout source, build then deploy/release voltha.pb to an artifact server/versioned download.\n\nDownstream repositories can then retrieve voltha.pb or a glob + prototypes from the artifact server for building.  Unit tests guard prototypes and behavior at the voltha-protos repository then consumers simply exercise their use of them.\n\n\nCurrently we tag github for release (which lacks binaries):\n  o https://github.com/opencord/voltha-protos/tags\n\nWhile consumers checkout a copy of the voltha-protos repo for access to compiled binaries and prototype headers.",
