      "message": "Question is, if we really want to or have to support this. I don\u0027t have the impression that it is really required from DT (and not yet available for TT anyway). Problem is that the effort of getting this is a bit higher compared to the other attributes (due to size). \nPerhaps these attributes are meant as kind of optional - perhaps also giving us the chance to support that later? But I don\u0027t know how that \u0027option\u0027 whould look like in the rpc ...\nSo - yes, it is possible to support and I would not exclude it from being feasible for 2.8, but I\u0027m not sure if it s really required (there is not really that much useful information for the operator).",
